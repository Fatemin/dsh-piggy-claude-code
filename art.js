/**
 * [ST0004] Dressing a pose. The contract is docs/contracts/art-assets.md
 * (ART.ASSETS.V1); tools/build-sprites.mjs writes both halves of it:
 *
 *   pose (行为资产)        assets/<pose>.svg carries one empty wear slot,
 *                          `<g class="wear" data-occupies="head eyes"></g>`,
 *                          naming the slots its own gear already covers.
 *   decoration (装饰资产)  assets/wear-<key>.svg keeps what goes into a slot
 *                          between `<!-- wear:begin -->` and `<!-- wear:end -->`.
 *
 * Pure string work, no file access: the art route reads the files and calls
 * `dress`. A pose without a slot (a box, a grave, a soul) is never dressed.
