/**
 * dsh-pig · core — the pure pig model.
 *
 * No IO, no ctx, no clock of its own: every function takes the current time as
 * a parameter, so the whole game model is testable in isolation. Nothing here
 * schedules a timer — shifts, courses, trips, illness progression and decay are
 * all resolved lazily from timestamps, which is why the pig survives restarts
 * and why the tests never have to wait.
 *
 * Three ways the pig changes:
 *   - `feed()`  digests a *passive* harness event (a turn ended, a tool ran)
 *   - `act()`   applies a *deliberate* care action (feed it, bathe it, play)
 *   - `buy()` / `useItem()` / `start*()` drive the game loop
 *
 * Time away from the desk is one concept, not three: work, study and travel all
 * become a single `activity` record, so "is the pig home?" has exactly one
 * answer and `decay()` has exactly one place to settle it.
 *
 * @module dsh-pig/core
